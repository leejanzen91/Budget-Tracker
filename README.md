# Budget-Tracker
This project primarily is a personal use code that I created for the sake of learning development practices and tools. The goals are creating a file processor with some basic barebones interaction, learning how to create a GUI system, and futher exposure to WPF, C#, and XAML.

Ideally, this code will work as a file processor to take digital bank statement PDF files (a "Jane Doe" sample will be included in the files). It will interact with a GUI system, that will display how well you are staying within budgets, track financial long term goal progress, and create monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports based on the data. I wanted my data to be kept on my private server rather than contuniing with Mint. I also wanted to feed it data from my entire household, which has a multitude of financial obligations and incomes to track in rather inconvient forms due to being a polyamourous unit with many interacting, but leagally not intertwined adults. There are an extensive amount of retriment accounts, funds, and investments to track in one polycule, and no real way to do that without paying a lot of money for commercial and business focused services. So I set out to find my solution here as the individual in charge of financial savvy, plus get some code practice in.
